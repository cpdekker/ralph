# [Feature Name] - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Brief description of what we're building and current status.

**Estimated total iterations**: X-Y

---

## Pre-flight Validation

- [ ] All dependencies are available (libraries, APIs, etc.)
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing interfaces
- [ ] Test infrastructure can validate the changes
- [ ] Spec has been reviewed and approved

---

## Phase 0: User Review Fixes

_Priority items from manual user review. Address these FIRST._
_Delete this section if `.ralph/user-review.md` is empty._

### 0.1 Bugs (from user testing)
- [ ] [Simple] [Bug description] - `path/to/file.ts:123`

### 0.2 Implementation Issues (user feedback)
- [ ] [Medium] [Issue description]

### 0.3 User Focus Areas
- [ ] [Simple] [Focus area description]

---

## Phase 0.5: Review Fixes

_Priority fixes from automated code review findings._
_Delete this section if `.ralph/review.md` doesn't exist._

### 0.5.1 Critical Issues
- [ ] [Medium] [Issue from review] - `path/to/file.ts:123`

### 0.5.2 Important Issues
- [ ] [Simple] [Issue from review]

---

## Phase 0.6: High-Risk Items

_Items that could affect existing functionality or require careful testing._

- [ ] [RISK] [Item that modifies shared code] - needs extra testing
- [ ] [RISK] [Item that changes database schema]

---

## Phase 1: [Category Name - e.g., Backend Types & Interfaces]

### 1.1 [Task Group Name]
- [ ] [Simple] Specific action item (~1 iteration)
  - Files: `path/to/file.ts`
- [ ] [Medium] Another action item (~2-3 iterations)
  - Dependencies: [1.0 Previous task]
  - Enables: [1.2 Next task, 2.1 Other task]
  - Files: `path/to/file1.ts`, `path/to/file2.ts`

### 1.2 [Next Task Group]
- [ ] [Complex] Action item (~5+ iterations, consider decomposition)
  - Dependencies: [1.1 Previous task]
  - Sub-tasks:
    - [ ] Sub-item 1
    - [ ] Sub-item 2

---

## Phase 2: [Next Category]

### 2.1 [Task Group]
- [ ] [Medium] Task description
  - Dependencies: [1.2 Previous task]

## Complexity Legend

| Tag | Estimated Iterations | Description |
|-----|---------------------|-------------|
| `[Simple]` | ~1 iteration | Single file, <50 lines, straightforward logic |
| `[Medium]` | ~2-3 iterations | Multiple files, moderate complexity |
| `[Complex]` | ~5+ iterations | Architectural changes, many files |
| `[RISK]` | +1-2 extra | Modifies shared code, needs extra testing |
| `[BLOCKED]` | — | Cannot proceed, needs human intervention |

---

## Discovered Issues

_Issues found during implementation that need to be addressed._

- [BLOCKED] Issue description - reason blocked, suggested approach

---

## Notes

_Important context, decisions, or clarifications._
